# Linear Algebra Project â€“ PythonProject3

This Jupyter Notebook contains symbolic computations for linear algebra tasks using the [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/) library in Python. It demonstrates key concepts in vector and matrix analysis, including:

- Dot products between vectors
- Construction of orthogonal and orthonormal bases
- Characteristic polynomial computation
- Eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis
- Diagonalization of matrices

## Contents

- `PythonProject3.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all calculations, explanations, and reusable functions for analyzing matrices A, B, and C.

## Getting Started

To run this notebook:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/annie-camp/linear-algebra-symbolic-python.git
   cd linear-algebra-symbolic-python
   ```

2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Run all cells in `PythonProject3.ipynb`.

> Make sure you have Python 3 and SymPy installed:
> ```bash
> pip install sympy
> ```
